# Vibe Pilot

Vibe Pilot is a project validation and orchestration engine designed for the era of Vibe Coding. It takes your raw ideas, runs a deep multi-model analysis, and generates a roadmap to success.

Build for BridgeMind Vibeathon 2026

## The Problem

Most hackathon projects fail not because of bad code, but because of bad planning. Developers waste hours setting up environments for ideas that haven't been validated against market reality or technical constraints.

Vibe Pilot solves this by acting as a pre-flight checklist. It doesn't just "chat" with you; it aggressively tests your idea against market viability and technical feasibility before a single line of code is written.

## Features
- **The Vibe Score:** An algorithmic evaluation of your project's market potential and technical feasibility.
- **Golden Prompt Generator:** Automatically creates a high-fidelity system prompt tailored for your specific app.
- **Dynamic Roadmap:** Generates a step-by-step execution plan from MVP to Production.
- **One-Click Execution:** Bridges the gap between "Idea" and "Terminal" (Optimized for Claude Code).
